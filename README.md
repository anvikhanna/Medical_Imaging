Abnormality detection of bones using Deep Learning Techniques

We introduce MURA (musculoskeletal radiographs), a large dataset of musculoskeletal radiographs and XRAY's containing images from 14,863 patient-studies where each study is manually labeled by radiologists as either normal or abnormal. It contains 9,045 normal and 5,818 abnormal XRAY's of the shoulder, humerus, elbow, forearm, wrist, hand, and finger. To this we sorted each of the folders and restructured the files for our convenience. We trained our model using the positive(i.e. abnormal XRAY's) and negetive(i.e. normal XRAY's) images. Upon training the data we keep a check on the accuracy.

The basic structure of our Deep Neural Network consists of input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. The goal of training deep learning architectures is optimization of the weight parameters calculated in each layer, which gradually combines simpler features into complex features so that the most suitable representations can be learned from data. CNN, is one of the most sucessful deep learning architectures among CNN, RNN and ResNet.

Medical images such as Xrays, CT Scans and MRI's to be analysed contain and need a lot of information regarding the structure to reveal valid diagnosis and thereby helping doctors choose adequate therapy. In order to reduce the error rate and perform the analysis faster, AI could be deployed.

Our project includes developing a machine learning algorithm for real clinical utility. This is carried out using the deep Learning technique, Convolution Neural Network(CNN). Among the many deep learning techniques we chose CNN which is one of the most sucessful deep learning architectures, known for its capacity to analyse spatial information. 

It is hoped that this study will automate abnormality localisation and improve the workflow of radiologists.Our project aims to aid the radiologist to confirm their diagnosis.
